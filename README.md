## ⚛️ About React

**React** is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Created by Facebook, React allows developers to build fast, dynamic, and scalable front-end applications using components.

### Why React was used in this project:

- **Component-based architecture**: Reusable and modular UI components.
- **Fast rendering**: React uses a virtual DOM to update the UI efficiently.
- **Declarative syntax**: Makes it easier to describe UI states and transitions.
- **Developer-friendly**: Works well with tools like Vite, Tailwind, and modern build systems.
